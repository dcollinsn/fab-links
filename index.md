## Useful Rulings

* [UK Nats Investigation Outcome](https://fabtcg.com/articles/uk-national-championship-investigation-outcome/)
  > Expectations of Professional-level play
  > National Championship events represent some of the highest levels of competition for Flesh and Blood and are ruled at a professional rules enforcement level. As such, we expect players to “play hard, and play fair”. Flesh and Blood is a game of skill, and we expect players to win games, and tournaments, through skilful play in an honest and fair manner, not through exploitation of the game rules, ‘rules sharking’, or ‘angle shooting’ to derive an unfair advantage. To be clear, this does not mean players are obliged to let their opponents ‘take back’ mistakes once a play has been made. **We strongly emphasize, however, that players are expected to hold themselves to the same standard that they hold their opponents to.**

  > ...
  > 
  > **The playspace** (defined by the outline of both player’s mats) **should be clear from obstruction** to preserve the integrity of physical communication and gameplay. **This includes oversized and/or all non-game related objects.** For the avoidance of doubt, the use of a die to represent the amount of resource you have remaining, ideally placed just above the pitch zone, is allowed and strongly encouraged.
  > 
  > Tokens that are not in play should not be present in the game space. This is clearly stated in the Tournament Rules and Policy document. Tokens such as Briar’s Embodiments, Runechants, Spectral Shields, and others, must not be present if they are not in play. It is not acceptable to have these in the game space “by default”, then use dice (or move them to a different position) to indicate when they are “active” or “present”.
* [Back Alley Oracle #1](https://fabtcg.com/articles/back-alley-oracle-1-comprehensive-rules-20-update/)
  > **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Because the reprise condition now is officially checked on resolution of the layer, there may be complications when players argue that any responding defense reactions are played before their card resolves and therefore the reprise condition would be met when their card resolves. However, **benefit of the doubt is given in any situation where it would be un-optimal to play a defense reaction that would allow the reprise condition to be met**. In example 2, this is a purely hypothetical situation that shows the consequence of the rules change - in this example **it would be ruled that Unmovable was played after Rout resolves to prevent cases of rules sharking and/or angling**.
